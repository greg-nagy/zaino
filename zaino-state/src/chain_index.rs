//! Holds Zaino's local chain index.
//!
//! Components:
//! - Mempool: Holds mempool transactions
//! - NonFinalisedState: Holds block data for the top 100 blocks of all chains.
//! - FinalisedState: Holds block data for the remainder of the best chain.
//!
//! - Chain: Holds chain / block structs used internally by the ChainIndex.
//!   - Holds fields required to:
//!     - a. Serve CompactBlock data dirctly.
//!     - b. Build trasparent tx indexes efficiently
//!   - NOTE: Full transaction and block data is served from the backend finalizer.
